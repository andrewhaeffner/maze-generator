# maze-generator

This is a python3 program that generates random mazes and displays them using cool-looking animations!

This is a work in progress that does not exactly have an end goal. I am finding it to be a really fun way to work on writing clean, modular code, since every time I add a new component to the program I find flaws in how I set up the GUI, the graphics, and the underlying structures and tools I use to represent and generate the mazes.

I am considering creating a counterpart to this program in javascript. It would be so cool to have a clean web/mobile app interface for these maze generators. I'll stick with python for at least a bit, though.

To run the program just download generator.py and do ```python3 generator.py``` in the terminal.

Here are some screenshots of prim's algorithm in action:
